### Setup:
After importing the workflow,
first type `.setup-better-dictionaries` into Alfred.


### Importing a Dictionary:
After setup, type `.dict-import` into Alfred.
Importing a dictionary could take up to 30 minutes.


### Note:
After each mac restart, for the first time when you run
the workflow, expect a comparatively slower search.
Subsequent searches should be instant.


### Known Issues:
 - The workflow doeesn't work if the theme is `Alfred Classic`
   If you must use that theme, duplicate that theme and use the
   duplicated one.
